# hardhat: Construct Modeling Packages

Building modeling packages is hard. A large amount of effort generally
goes into providing an implementation for a new method that is
efficient, fast, and correct, but often less emphasis is put on the user
interface. A good interface requires specialized knowledge about S3
methods and formulas, which the average package developer might not
have. The goal of 'hardhat' is to reduce the burden around building new
modeling packages by providing functionality for preprocessing,
predicting, and validating input.
